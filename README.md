## Overview

The following is an [JS object](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp) which represents our application's `state`. Understanding how to work with this object is critical implementing the behavior of this application.

```javascript
{
  "tweets": [
    {
      "body": "Practice on many types of different applications",
      "likes": [
        "PrimeTimeTran",
        "Phil"
      ],
      "retweets": [
        {
          "body": "Sounds like a good idea to me!",
          "likes": [],
          "createdAt": "2019-05-26T06:32:25.172Z",
          "userName": "Chung2klee"
        }
      ],
      "createdAt": "2019-05-26T05:13:17.363Z",
      "userName": "BoomBoomRay"
    },
    {
      "body": "Study hard to learn programming.",
      "likes": [
        "BoomBoomRay",
        "PrimeTimeTran",
        "Hieu"
      ],
      "retweets": [],
      "createdAt": "2019-05-26T05:13:11.748Z",
      "userName": "BoomBoomRay"
    }
  ],
  "currentUser": "BoomBoomRay"
}
```

## Time Spent and Lessons Learned

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total.

I learned how to implement a 'react-like' structure for the application using JS. After a few refactors the code ended up a lot cleaner. I also learned how forms work in bootstrap better. If properly setup they can fire actions on enter press without an event listener.
