## Time Spent and Lessons Learned

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total.

I learned how to implement a 'React-like' structure for the application using JS. After a few refactors the code ended up a lot cleaner. I also learned how forms work in bootstrap better. If properly setup they can fire actions on enter press without an event listener.
